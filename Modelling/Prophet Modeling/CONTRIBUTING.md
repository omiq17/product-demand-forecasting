# Contributing to Prophet Modeling

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the Prophet Modeling repository.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug Reports**: Found a bug? Let us know!
- **Feature Requests**: Have an idea for improvement? Share it!
- **Code Contributions**: Bug fixes, new features, or improvements
- **Documentation**: Help improve our docs
- **Testing**: Add or improve test coverage

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git fork https://github.com/yourusername/prophet-modeling.git
   ```

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prophet-modeling.git
   cd prophet-modeling
   ```

3. **Create a Development Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small (< 50 lines when possible)

### Example Code Style
```python
def preprocess_data(df: pd.DataFrame, outlier_threshold: float = 0.85) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Preprocess e-commerce data for forecasting.
    
    Args:
        df: Raw e-commerce dataframe
        outlier_threshold: Percentile threshold for outlier removal
        
    Returns:
        Preprocessed dataframe ready for modeling
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If required columns are missing
    """
    required_cols = ["category_name_1", "M-Y", "qty_ordered"]
    if not all(col in df.columns for col in required_cols):
        raise ValueError(f"Missing required columns: {required_cols}")
    
    # Rest of implementation...
    return processed_df
```

### Testing

- Add unit tests for new functions
- Use `pytest` for testing framework
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add docstrings with proper formatting
- Include examples in documentation
- Update methodology docs for algorithm changes

## üîß Development Setup

### Required Tools

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# This includes:
# - pytest (testing)
# - black (code formatting)
# - flake8 (linting)
# - mypy (type checking)
# - jupyter (notebook development)
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

We recommend setting up pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This will automatically run code formatting and linting before each commit.
